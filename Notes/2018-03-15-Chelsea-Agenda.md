##### ESRI ArcGIS

- [Survey123 for ArcGIS]() allows for the creation of flexible, mobile-ready surveys. Users can georeference assets using an intuitive interface.
- A webmap using the ArcGIS Online platform can display survey results, updating automatically as users add assets. Different asset types can be symbolized using different colors or icons. Pop-up windows can display additional asset information.
- The webmap can then be used as the basis to build a web application, leveraging one of the ArcGIS templates.
