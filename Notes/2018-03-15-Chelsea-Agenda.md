# City of Chelsea Cultural Asset Survey: 03.15.18 Kick-off Meeting

### Platform Options

##### ESRI ArcGIS

- [Survey123 for ArcGIS](https://survey123.arcgis.com/) allows for the creation of flexible, mobile-ready surveys. Members of the public can georeference assets using an intuitive interface. The platform's back-end interface is also quite intuitive, allowing administrators to quickly build and modify surveys. I've begun building a survey mock-up [here](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/32f0197edcde4b5ca8f9ca9df6ece0b5).
- A webmap using the ArcGIS Online platform can display survey results, updating automatically as users add assets through the survey. Assets can be symbolized by type using different colors or icons. Pop-up windows can display additional asset information and photos. Webmaps can be embedded in any webpage and displayed alongside contextual information. [This mock-up](https://todd-horner.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=087e072c7c6f42478b51baa8538de8cb) demonstrates basic popup windows and layer filtering.
- The webmap can then be used as the basis to build a web application, leveraging one of the ArcGIS templates, for example:
  - The "Shortlist" template combines photos, descriptive text, and the ability to filter by item type. [Lynwood, WA used the template to map historical sites and public art](http://lynnwoodwa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Shortlist/index.html?appid=be2006d5382a4da5ab274b2f00e86194). Unfortunately, applications that use the shortlist template do not update dynamically. A manual update, however, is relatively easily and requires little technical knowledge.
  - The "Map Tour" template is great for presenting a spatial narrative our tour itinerary. [Tempe, AZ used the template to create a historical tour.](http://tempegov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=9dadb6c38e1c43d0b038f7046acdf4b0)

##### Ushahidi

- Open source mapping tool for crowdsourcing geospatial data.
- Free license allows for the creation of one survey.
- Surveys are easy to build but not as feature-rich as Survey123 for ArcGIS.
- An example deployment can be found [here](https://deer.ushahidi.io/views/map).
- The platform includes optional moderation of survey entries.

### Other examples and considered platforms

- [The Culture Blocks tool](https://www.cultureblocks.com/wordpress/), which is built on top of the [Policy Map](https://www.policymap.com/) platform, aims to map the relationships between cultural assets and land use, economic developments, and demographics. The tool doesn't allow users to add data, but provides a nice example of layering cultural assets with other planning issues.
- Google Maps, which was used in the [PAM Holyoke](http://www.oneholyoke.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PAM-Holyoke-Community-Report_FMM.pdf) project, does provide some out-of-the box connectivity with Google Forms, which can be used for surveys. Google Maps can geotag survey entries using address data, but doesn't allow users to drop a pin on map. Survey respondents would not be able to geotag assets not closely associated with a street address.

### Outreach

- To your knowledge, who are the key stakeholders that I should approach for data or input?
- Is their a specific venue, event, or group that I should approach about an asset mapping workshop and platform demonstration?

### Project Scope

- The scope of work for my graduate assistantship focuses on development of the dynamic mapping platform as well as initial data population. My Master's Project will dovetail off of work completed during the assistantship. What complementary work, report, or materials would you find most useful?

### Data

- The proposed data schema can be previewed [here](https://umass.box.com/s/aqnle8x0qlhw5ka844q1thm1qcjcppku).
- The Tufts students have already geocoded some cultural assets. Is this georeferenced data available? If so, with whom should I speak about accessing it? It's easy enough to geocode it again, but in the interest of of not duplicating work, I thought I'd ask.
- As one individual with a limited timeframe, my capacity to do primary data collection will be limited. Which areas and asset types should I prioritize for field work?
