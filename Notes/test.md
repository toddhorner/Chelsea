# Agenda for 03.15.2018 Kick-off Meeting with Chelsea Planning Department

## Technology

##### ESRI ArcGIS

- [Survey123 for ArcGIS](https://survey123.arcgis.com/) allows for the creation of flexible, mobile-ready surveys. Members of the public can georeference assets using an intuitive interface. The platform's back-end interface is also quite intuitive, allowing administrators to quickly build and modify surveys. I've begun building a survey mock-up [here](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/32f0197edcde4b5ca8f9ca9df6ece0b5).
- A webmap using the ArcGIS Online platform can display survey results, updating automatically as users add assets. Assets can be symbolized by type using different colors or icons. Pop-up windows can display additional asset information.
- The webmap can then be used as the basis to build a web application, leveraging one of the ArcGIS templates, for example:
  - The "Shortlist" template combines photos, descriptive text, and the ability to sort by item type. [Lynwood, WA used the template to map historical sites and public art](http://lynnwoodwa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Shortlist/index.html?appid=be2006d5382a4da5ab274b2f00e86194).
